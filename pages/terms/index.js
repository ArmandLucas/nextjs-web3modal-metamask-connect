        <h2>1. SMART CONTRACT ENABLED</h2>
        <p>
          PROOF Collective NFT is a non-fungible Ethereum-based token that uses
          smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain (“Smart Contracts”). The
          Ethereum blockchain provides an immutable ledger of all transactions
          that occur on the blockchain. This means that all PROOF Collective
          NFTs are outside of the control of any one party, including PROOF, and
          are subject to many risks and uncertainties. PROOF neither owns nor
          controls MetaMask, WalletConnect, the Ethereum network, your br
          /owser, or any other third party site, product, or service (including
          third party wallets or marketplaces) that you might access, visit, or
          use for the purpose of enabling you to use the Services or to
          purchase, list, auction, or sell PROOF Collective NFTs
          (“Transaction”), and that, except with respect to transferring control
          of a PROOF Collective NFT to the initial purchaser through the
          Services (“Initial Purchaser”), PROOF has no responsibility with
          respect to any Transaction. PROOF will not be liable for the acts or
          omissions of any third parties, nor will PROOF be liable for any
          damage that you may suffer as a result of your transactions or any
          other interaction with any third parties. You understand that your
          Ethereum public address will be made publicly visible whenever you
          engage in a Transaction. Aside from transferring control of the PROOF
          Collective NFT to the Initial Purchaser, PROOF has no control over the
          transfer, storage, ownership or maintenance of the PROOF Collective
          NFT.
        </p>
        <h2>2. CHANGES TO THE SERVICES</h2>
        <p>
          PROOF reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
          permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without
          notice. You agree that PROOF will not be liable to you or to any third
          party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the
          Services, including in relation to any PROOF Collective NFT.
        </p>
        <h2>3. PROOF PERKS</h2>
        <p>
          A Collector (as defined below) of a PROOF Collective NFT may receive
          special perks, experience, or opportunities as determined by PROOF in
          its sole discretion (“Perks”) for a period of three (3) years after
          the PROOF Collective NFTs are first made available for sale (i.e.,
          dropped) by PROOF. PROOF does not make any representation or guarantee
          that any Collector will receive any Perks or achieve any particular
          outcome as a result of owning any PROOF Collective NFT. PROOF reserves
          the right, at its sole discretion, to restrict, limit, or deny any
          Perks to any Collector, including to limit the period of time when a
          Perk is available, for any reason, at any time. Perks are not intended
          to be an endorsement of any project, creator, NFT, individual or any
          other thing, and PROOF makes no recommendation and provides no
          investment advice in connection with any Perks or otherwise as a
          result of holding or owning the PROOF Collective NFT.
        </p>
        <h2>4. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD, AND SECURITY</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          account and password, if any, and are fully responsible for any and
          all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to
          (a) immediately notify PROOF of any unauthorized use of your password
          or account or any other br /each of security, and (b) ensure that you
          exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the
          Services. PROOF will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
          your failure to comply with this Section.
        </p>
        <h2>5. CONNECTING YOUR WALLET</h2>
        <p>
          In order to access and use the Services, including engaging in a
          Transaction on the Services, you must connect your account to your
          digital wallet supported on MetaMask, WalletConnect or other wallet
          extensions or gateways as allowed on the Services. Such digital
          wallets allow you to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using
          the native Ethereum cryptocurrency, ETH. When you link your
          cryptocurrency wallet, you understand and agree that you are solely
          responsible for maintaining the security of your wallet and your
          control over any wallet-related authentication credentials, private or
          public cryptocurrency keys, non-fungible tokens or cryptocurrencies
          that are stored in or are accessible through your wallet. Any
          unauthorized access to your cryptocurrency wallet by third parties
          could result in the loss or theft of PROOF Collective NFTs and/or
          funds held in your wallet and any associated wallets, including any
          linked financial information such as bank account(s) or credit
          card(s). PROOF is not responsible for managing and maintaining the
          security of your cryptocurrency wallet. PROOF has no responsibility or
          liability to you for any unauthorized access to or use of your
          cryptocurrency wallet or if you are unable to locate your credentials.
          If you notice any unauthorized or suspicious activity in your
          cryptocurrency wallet that seems to be related to the Services, please
          notify us immediately.
        </p>
        <h2>6. SALE OF PROOF COLLECTIVE NFT</h2>
        <p>
          When each PROOF Collective NFT is sold for the first time, the
          agreement for sale is between PROOF and the Initial Purchaser. If the
          Initial Purchaser decides to sell a PROOF Collective NFT (“Secondary
          Sale”), then PROOF is not a party to any agreement between the
          applicable buyer, seller, or facilitator of the Secondary Sale.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you or any owner of a PROOF Collective NFT (“Collector”) sells or
          transfers a PROOF Collective NFT to another collector, (a) the you, as
          Collector, represents and warrants that you will notify the subsequent
          collector of these Terms and require the subsequent collector to
          comply with these Terms, (b) the Collector License (as defined below)
          as set forth herein will automatically transfer to such subsequent
          collector, and such other collector will be deemed the “Collector”
          (for purposes of such PROOF Collective NFT and the Collector License
          to the underlying NFT IP (as defined below)) and will be subject to
          these Terms, and (c) you, as the seller or transferor of such PROOF
          Collective NFT, will cease to have any further rights to such PROOF
          Collective NFT or underlying NFT IP.
        </p>
        <p>
          By placing an order on the Site or through the Services (including by
          bidding in an auction), you agree that you are submitting a binding
          offer to purchase a PROOF Collective NFT, you agree to pay all
          applicable fees associated with the Transaction, and you authorize
          PROOF to automatically charge and collect such fees from your payment
          instrument or wallet. If you are an Initial Purchaser, then all
          amounts due are to be paid to PROOF. If you are not the Initial
          Purchaser of a PROOF Collective NFT, then amounts may be paid to the
          seller of such PROOF Collective NFT.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that PROOF receives 7.5% of every Secondary
          Sale of a PROOF Collective NFT (“Royalty”). PROOF has the right to
          collect Royalties for PROOF sales in perpetuity. As such, if you sell
          a PROOF Collective NFT on a third-party marketplace, you agree to
          include a statement substantially similar to the following in the
          description of the NFT: “7.5% Royalty Applies. See PROOF Collective
          NFT Terms of Use for details.”
        </p>
        <p>
          No refunds are permitted except with respect to any statutory
          warranties or guaranties that cannot be excluded or limited by law.
        </p>
        <h2>7. TAXES</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for any and all sales, use, value-added and other
          taxes, duties, and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed by
          any governmental authority, associated with your use of the Services,
          Perks or PROOF Collective NFTs (including, without limitation, any
          taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership,
          transfer, purchase, or sale of a PROOF Collective NFT).
        </p>
        <h2>8. PROOF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that the Services may contain content or
          features (“Services Content”) that are protected by copyright, patent,
          trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights and laws. Except
          as expressly authorized by PROOF, you agree not to modify, copy,
          frame, scrape, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create
          derivative works based on the Services or the Services Content, in
          whole or in part. Any use of the Services or the Services Content
          other than as specifically authorized herein is strictly prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          PROOF's name and logos are trademarks and service marks of PROOF
          (collectively the “PROOF Trademarks”). Other company, product, and
          service names and logos used and displayed via the Services may be
          trademarks or service marks of their respective owners who may or may
          not endorse or be affiliated with or connected to PROOF. Nothing in
          these Terms or the Services should be construed as granting, by
          implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right to use any
          of PROOF Trademarks displayed on the Services, without PROOF's prior
          written permission in each instance. All goodwill generated from the
          use of PROOF Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.
        </p>
        <h2>9. YOUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>
        <p>
          You acknowledge and agree that PROOF (or, as applicable, its
          licensors) owns all legal rights, title and interest in all
          intellectual property rights of the content underlying PROOF
          Collective NFTs (“NFT IP”), including but not limited to copyrights
          and trademarks in the NFT IP. As the copyright owner, PROOF has the
          exclusive right to reproduce, prepare derivatives of, distribute,
          display, perform and otherwise exercise and exploit the NFT IP,
          subject to Collector Licenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subject to continued compliance with these Terms, PROOF grants
          Collector a limited, worldwide, non-assignable and non-transferable
          (except as part of a Secondary Sale), non-sublicensable, royalty-free
          license to display the NFT IP solely for the Collector's
          non-commercial purposes (except as expressly permitted herein),
          including the right to display such NFT IP privately or publicly: (i)
          for the purpose of promoting or sharing the Collector's purchase of,
          ownership of, or interest in such PROOF Collective NFT, (ii) for the
          purpose of sharing, promoting, discussing, or commenting on such PROOF
          Collective NFT or NFT IP; (iii) on third party marketplaces,
          exchanges, platforms, or applications in association with a
          Transaction of the PROOF Collective NFT; and (iv) within decentralized
          virtual environments, virtual worlds, virtual galleries, virtual
          museums, or other navigable and perceivable virtual environments (the
          “Collector License”). While the Collector has the right to sell,
          trade, transfer, or use their PROOF Collective NFT, the Collector may
          not make commercial use of the NFT IP.
        </p>
        <h2>10. No Investment Advice; Investment Risks</h2>
        <p>
          The information on this Site and any information provided in
          connection with the Services or Perks are provided to PROOF Collective
          NFT owners only and for information only and do not constitute, and
          should not be construed as, investment advice or a recommendation to
          buy, sell, or otherwise transact in any digital asset including any
          products or services or an invitation, offer or solicitation to engage
          in any investment activity with respect to any digital asset.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information on this Site and any information provided in
          connection with the Services or Perks provided to PROOF Collective NFT
          owners are provided solely on the basis that you will make your own
          investment and trading decisions, and PROOF does not take account of
          any person's investment objectives, particular needs, or financial
          situation. In addition, nothing on this Site or any information
          provided in connection with the Services or Perks provided to PROOF
          Collective NFT owners shall, or is intended to, constitute financial,
          legal, accounting or tax advice. It is strongly recommended that you
          seek professional investment advice before making any investment
          decision. Any investment decision that you make should be based on an
          assessment of your risks in consultation with your investment adviser.
        </p>
        <p>
          The digital assets about which information is provided on the Site and
          any information provided in connection with the Services or Perks
          provided to PROOF Collective NFT owners are not viewed by the issuer
          or sponsor of any such digital assets, or those buying or selling the
          digital asset, as securities under U.S. laws or relevant applicable
          laws. As a result it is unlikely that fulsome disclosures from the
          issuer or sponsor, or any executive officer associated with the
          digital asset or related protocol have been provided, and others may
          have better or more information than the information made available to
          you via the Site, any information provided in connection with the
          Services or Perks provided to PROOF Collective NFT owners or to which
          you may independently have access.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are risks associated with purchasing and holding digital assets.
          Loss of the full amount of the purchase price is possible. Volatility
          is highly likely, and some of the protocols and platforms may fail
          entirely due to forking, flaws in the code, hacking or other malicious
          attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          THESE TERMS DO NOT REPRESENT A COMPLETE STATEMENT OF RISK FACTORS
          ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIGITAL ASSETS OR PRODUCTS THAT MAY BE VIEWED OR
          TRACKED ON THIS SITE OR THAT MAY BE FEATURED OR DISCUSSED IN
          CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES OR PERKS FOR PROOF COLLECTIVE NFT OWNERS.
          YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THESE RISK WARNINGS CAREFULLY AND TAKE APPROPRIATE
          ADVICE BEFORE TAKING ANY DECISION TO PURCHASE OR TRADE A DIGITAL
          ASSET.
        </p>
        <h2>11. RESTRICTIONS</h2>

        <h2>12. PRIVACY</h2>
        <p>
          Our Privacy Policy is a part of these Terms. Please review the Privacy
          Policy, which also governs the Services and informs Users of our data
          collection practices.
        </p>
        <h2>13. RISKS</h2>
        <p>
          Please note the following risks in accessing, purchasing, selling or
          using PROOF Collective NFTs: The price and liquidity of blockchain
          assets, including PROOF Collective NFTs, are extremely volatile and
          may be subject to large fluctuations. Fluctuations in the price of
          other digital assets could materially and adversely affect PROOF
          Collective NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price
          volatility. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the
          state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use,
          transfer, exchange, and value of PROOF Collective NFTs. PROOF
          Collective NFTs are not legal tender and are not backed by any
          government. Transactions of PROOF Collective NFTs may be irreversible,
          and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions
          may not be recoverable. Some Transactions of PROOF Collective NFTs
          shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is
          not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the Transaction.
          The value of PROOF Collective NFTs may be derived from the continued
          willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or
          digital assets for PROOF Collective NFTs, which may result in the
          potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular PROOF
          Collective NFT.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for
          determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and
          appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that we do not give
          advice or recommendations regarding PROOF Collective NFTs, including
          the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for,

          activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the

          or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to
          the Services or Perks under any provision of these Terms may be

          <li>
            Agreement to Arbitrate
            <br />
            This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred
            to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any
            and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you
            and PROOF, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms
            (including any alleged br /each thereof), the Services, PROOF
            Collective NFTs, Perks, any advertising, or any aspect of the
            relationship or transactions between us, will be resolved
            exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than a
            court, in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement,
            except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court,
            if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not
            preclude you from br /inging issues to the attention of federal,
            state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows,
            seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering
            into these Terms, you and PROOF are each waiving the right to a
            trial by jury or to participate in a class action. Your rights will
            be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. The
            Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement
            of this Arbitration Agreement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
            Non-Individualized Relief
            <br />
            YOU AND PROOF AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY br /ING CLAIMS AGAINST THE
            OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS
            MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR
            PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PROOF AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR
            PARTY'S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A
            CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE
            ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND
            DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING
            RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF
            NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S), EXCEPT THAT YOU
            MAY PURSUE A CLAIM FOR AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD PUBLIC
            INJUNCTIVE RELIEF UNDER APPLICABLE LAW TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR
            THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS PROVISION.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution
            <br />
            PROOF is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and
            efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and
            to the customer's satisfaction by emailing PROOF at
            support@proof.xyz. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, a party who
            intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by
            certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice
            to PROOF should be sent to PROOF - 5331 S Macadam Ave #258-202,
            Portland, OR 97239 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe
            the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the
            specific relief sought. If PROOF and you do not resolve the claim
            within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or
            PROOF may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the
            arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by PROOF or you
            will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator
            determines the amount, if any, to which you or PROOF is entitled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arbitration Procedures
            <br />
            Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance
            with the American Arbitration Association's (“AAA”) rules and
            procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules
            (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration
            Agreement. For information on the AAA, please visit its website,
            http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for
            consumer disputes can be found at the AAA's consumer arbitration
            page, https://www.adr.org/consumer. If there is any inconsistency
            between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration
            Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will
            control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the
            inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a
            fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the
            provisions of these Terms as a court would. All issues are for the
            arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope,
            enforceability, and arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement.
            Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more
            streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the
            arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual
            basis that a court can award to an individual under these Terms and
            applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court
            and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
            <br />
            Unless PROOF and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will
            take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with
            due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent
            circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the
            determination will be made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or
            less, PROOF agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will
            be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the
            arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing
            as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the
            right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless
            of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator
            will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the
            essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
          </li>
          <li>
            Costs of Arbitration
            <br />
            Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees
            (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA
            Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If
            the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request,
            PROOF will pay all Arbitration Fees. If the value of relief sought
            is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the
            arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion of
            the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for
            any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of
            the Arbitration Fees, PROOF will pay your portion of such fees. In
            addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of
            arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of
            litigation, PROOF will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the
            arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
            cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by
            the AAA Rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confidentiality
            <br />
            All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision,
            or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the
            benefit of all parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Severability
            <br />
            If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of
            this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) above
            titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and
            Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the
            parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or
            provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
            expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
            provision, and this Arbitration Agreement will be enforceable as so
            modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the
            provisions of subsection (b) above titled “Prohibition of Class and
            Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or
            unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement will
            be null and void, unless such provisions are deemed to be invalid or
            unenforceable solely with respect to claims for public injunctive
            relief. The remainder of these Terms will continue to apply.
          </li>
          <li>
            Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement
            <br />
            Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, PROOF
            agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration
            Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are
            a User of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending
            PROOF written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change
            to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future
            change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between
            us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as
            of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any
            subsequent changes to these Terms).

        <h2>21. SEVERABILITY</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent
          jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the
          court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
          reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms
